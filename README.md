# Wobbegong-Fury
Summary: 

A simple one-button overhead arcade game.

Design Document:

Wobbegong Fury is an overhead game. It takes place in three scenes: the start scene, the game scene, and the end scene.

Start Scene:

  A pretty screen with the words "Wobbegong Fury!" The words "Press Start" blink below.

Game scene:

One screen. Overhead view. An ocean floor. Tan sand speckled with various shades of randomly generated pixelated sea grasses waving in their own tempo.
  The player controls a wobbegong who spawns in the center of the screen. The wobbegong has an energy score and a size score. The wobbegong slowly rotates. The player can press their button at any time to temporarily stop the rotation and create a launch bar.
  The launch bar slowly grows and shrinks, its length representing the power the wobbegong will launch with. When the player presses the button, the wobbegong launches forward, bouncing off the edge of the screen, if it hits it.
  Around the wobbegong, fish swim. The wobbegong comsumes the fish when one of them touche it, giving it a set amount of their energy and size. Each type of fish is its own color.
  The Wobbegong's energy score slowly decreases. When it decreases, it moves to the end scene and records the player's size as the high score.
  
End Scene:
 
  The player is greeted with a sad wobbegong holding a fork and knife and the words, "Game Over!"
  Below it are a list of the top ten high scores:
